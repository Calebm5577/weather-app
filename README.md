This is my first project working with an API. My goal was to be able to display cities by searching. 

After I got that working I realized the API I was using made it difficult to find smaller cities if the city shared a name with
a larger one. 

After playing around with the country state searches I realized they did not work very well. Searching by zip code 
was much more efficient so I decided to try and find out how to switch searches with a click of a button.

The final functionality I added was the page auto searching for San Francisco becuase of the background image I decided to use.
